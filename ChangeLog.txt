Added SCCRW step class.

Added a new step type: Super-Correlated-Composite-Random-Walk (SCCRW).
The SCCRW changes the likelihood to re-enter the correlated movement 
mode when entered in step before, that is, once in search phase, the 
RWer is more likely to re-enter search phase.

TODO:
	- Speed up live-plotting.
	- Document Code and update doc style. 
	- Add random time step length and speeds.
	
Additions:
	- Added RWstep.SCCRW class with functionalities.
	- Added additional example.
	
Changes:

Bugfixes:
	- Fixed bug in RWwalker.plotTraj
