# PyRW
A Python based 2D random walk simulation tool box

## Features

- Allows any type of 2D domain out of different geometrical features  
- Allows for any type of random walker, since random walks can be stacked upon each other as superpositions,such as 
	+ Brownian Walker
	+ Correlated Random Walker
	+ Composite Random Walker
	+ Correlated Composite Random Walker
- Each random walker can respond to each geometrical feature differently with various implemted boundary conditions
- Each random walker can respond to any other random walker differently with various implemted hitting conditions
- Live plotting
- Final Statistics

## Installation

python setup.py install
